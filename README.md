# PipeLined CPU
This is a toy CPU for ZJU course *computer organization*, which supports basic RISCV-32 commands

# Project Organization
- The mem data(\*.s, binary assembly code) are in ```./MemData/```
- The definition files(\*.vh), verilog files are in ```./Componets```
- The assembly files(\*.s) are in ```./Assembly```

# Trouble Shooting
**NOTE** 
- After cloneing or forking this repo, you should first config the paths of the memory files in your IDE(e.g. ISE or Vivado), otherwise it may cause some issues.
- If you want to implememt your own assmebly files, you need to replace the **binary** files, not the assmebly files.
